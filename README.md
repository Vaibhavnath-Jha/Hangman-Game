# Hangman-Game

A simple Local multiplayer game made on Python3 then linked it through *Repl.it* to generate an embedded link for the python console.
Made a sweet little HTML landing page to host it.

The best part about this project is that there is no need of having a movie database. Everything is handled by OMDb's API service.

Enjoy the built.
