# Hangman-Game

A simple local multiplayer game made on Python3.<br/>
Linked the program through *Repl.it* to generate an embedded link for the python console.<br/>
Made a sweet little HTML landing page to host it.

The best part about this project is that there is no need of having a movie database. Everything is handled by OMDb's API service.

Enjoy the built! :smile:
